Level of Achievement & Scope
Our team is at the level of achievement of Apollo 11. We have a scope of any organizations that aim to take physical attendance for any form of gathering, provided that photos of the attendees are provided. 
Problem Motivation
The reason why we decided to develop such an application is that we have found the traditional methods of taking attendance have many limitations that make the attendance troublesome and very ineffective. Taking examples of various attendance systems in schools, the student card scanner allows students to tap cards on behalf of another student or to tap cards outside the door and escape class. The physical paper and pen attendance will be time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly when a large number of students are involved. Also, Google Form, Kahoot, or Telegram Bot is ineffective in the sense that it is really easy for students to cheat. Last but not the least, high resolution CCTV with facial recognition is costly and troublesome with installation and maintenance. 
Core Features
With all these typical traditional methods for taking attendance, we are motivated to develop an application called Attendance+ that aims to be more effective, accurate, and cheaper. The core features in our application are the use of bluetooth and facial recognition. These features can be easily achieved with the use of mobile phones. The use of bluetooth ensures that the attendees must be present within the range of the bluetooth. The use of facial recognition ensures the attendees are the correct people in the gathering. 
User Stories
It is easy to use Attendance+. Logging into the application with ID provided by the respective organization, the user can have the following operation. If the user wishes to host the attendance taking process, he can proceed to the host end and establish the connection with the use of bluetooth mode on his mobile phone. If the user is an attendee and wishes to take attendance, he just needs to look for the respective host name and connect it with bluetooth, and lastly scan his face, to make the attendance taking process complete.
